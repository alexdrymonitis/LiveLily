LiveLily is a live sequencing and live scoring system through live coding with a Lilypond-like language. The system includes a text editor, a parser, a sequencer, and an interactive/animated score. The commands are inspired by the Lilypond language, with certain commands that accommodate fast typing and fast coding sequences being added.

LiveLily does not produce any sound. It sends messages either with OSC or MIDI, to control other software and hardware. It can be combined with the LiveLily-Score, to display one part of the full score, that can be sight-read by an instrumentalist. The possible setups that LiveLily supports are pure electronic, electroacoustic, or acoustic only.
