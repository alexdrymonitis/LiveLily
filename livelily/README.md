# LiveLily

This is the main LiveLily program. It contains the editor, the parser, the sequencer, and the interactive/animated full score. This program can be used combined with audio-generating software that support either the OSC or the MIDI protocol. It can also be used combined with the LiveLily-Score program, that displays one part of the full score, to be sight-read by an instrumentalist, in case of live scoring an acoustic instrument or ensemble.

These two scenarios can be user either separately, or combined, to control an electroacoustic live coding session.
