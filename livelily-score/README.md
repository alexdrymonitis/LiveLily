# LiveLily-Score

This is the accompaying program of LiveLily. It displays one part of the full score, to be sight-read by an instrumentalist.
It has to be combined with LiveLily, in an acoustic or electroacoustic session. Read more in the livelily/ directory.

For now this directory is empty. In the near future, the files for compiling the score part of LiveLily will be uploaded.
