# LiveLily Score Part
![LiveLily logo](../images/livelily_logo_scaled.png?raw=true)

This is a complement program to LiveLily that displays one part of the full score, so it can be sight read by an instrumentalist for live scoring sessions.

It is a passive program that receives OSC messages from the main LiveLily program, and displays whatever is written and selected from there.
